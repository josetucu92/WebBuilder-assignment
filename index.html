              Why you should hire an agent who has partnered with a luxury real
              estate marketing company.
            </h2>
            <p>
              One of the biggest perks of working with a real estate agent is
              their ability to market your property to the right target
              audience. A professional agent with the right experience will be
              able to identify who will be interested in your property and
              implement effective strategies to reach them via their website,
              paid advertising, social media, and other means. When you work
              with an agent who has partnered with Luxury Presence, you benefit
              from the many different types of marketing capabilities the
              company offers. Here is how:

            <h2>Paid Advertising on All Channels</h2>
            <p>
              To reach your potential buyers, you have to know who they are,
              where they spend their time online, and how they make their buying
              decisions. Agents who use luxury real estate marketing services
              are able to identify your niche market, then create paid ads on
              Facebook, Google, Instagram, and YouTube that reach those
              interested in your property. These paid ad campaigns are highly
              customized and targeted, ensuring you are not spending money
              marketing to those who are not in the market for a property such
              as yours.

            <h2>Expert Content Production</h2>
            <p>
              Content is one of the most powerful resources a real estate agent
              has to promote your property. Being able to create high-quality
              content such as video and copywriting is an essential tool that
              elevates the agents who use luxury real estate marketing services
              above their competitors. According to a recent survey, 85 percent
              of buyers and sellers want to work with an agent who uses
              video—and for good reason. An agent who uses video is able to
              connect with potential buyers on a deeper level and build trust
              and rapport. When they use video to market your property, they are
              showing viewers what it would really be like to walk through and
              live in your home—something that is much more difficult to do with
              a written description.
              However, written descriptions—or copywriting—is also important.
              Your property needs to be described in appealing and vibrant terms
              on the listing and on any additional marketing that is created to
              sell it. Those agents who work with Luxury Presence get access to
              experienced real estate copywriters who create blogs, website
              copy, and content marketing pieces that make your property
              attractive to potential buyers.

            <h2>Effective Search Engine Optimization</h2>
            <p>
              Recent research has shown that 44% of buyers found the home they
              purchased on the internet. Many of them simply googled the search
              terms that they wanted in a new home and started their search that
              way. For your home to show up in these types of searches, your
              real estate agent needs to use the right terms in your online
              marketing. The effective use of these terms is referred to as
              search engine optimization or SEO. The process of identifying and
              correctly using the right terms is a bit of a science—one that the
              SEO experts at Luxury Presence have mastered. When a potential
              buyer searches terms that match your home, your property will show
              up in the results and provide opportunities for the buyer to learn
              more.

            <h2>Social Media Marketing</h2>
            <p>
              If your real estate agent is an influencer on social media, he or
              she has access to thousands of niche buyers who are ready to
              invest in property. To be an influencer, an agent either needs to
              dedicate a large chunk of their time to social media or they need
              to partner with luxury real estate marketing service providers who
              can put in the work for them. Wouldn’t you rather your agent spent
              his or her time marketing your property and let an expert handle
              their social media presence? At Luxury Presence, our dedicated
              success team utilizes an agent’s stories and feed posts to help
              them go viral and become an authority in their industry. Once
              they’ve harnessed the power of becoming an influencer, they can
              use their voice to advocate for your home and sell it more quickly
              than their competitors.
